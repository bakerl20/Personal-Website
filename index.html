                        Hello, my name is Luke Baker. I am from Alexandria, Kentucky and have lived here my entire life. I attended Campbell County Highschool, where I graduated Summe Cum Laude. Now, I am a sophomore at Northern Kentucky University studying Marketing. In the four semesters I have been here, I have been honored with joining the National Society and Leadership Success as well as joining the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity. I spent my last year in school learning java, html, and CSS. I prefer to write code in python, where I believe my coding strength shows.

                        Growing up, I played soccer all day everyday. I was pretty good but I lost the passion for it, so I haven't picked it back up in a few years. Now, One of my favorite things to do in my free time is to golf. As soon as I quit playing soccer, I started golfing. If I'm not golfing, I like to watch TV shows like Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad. I consider myself an artistic-abled person, but I hardly draw anything besides cartoon characters. I have also played video games for as long as I can remember. Now, I play a lot of Rocket League, so much so that I am in the top 6% skill level. My favorite music artist is Zach Bryan or Tyler Childers.
